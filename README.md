# Sentiment Analysis App

This repository contains a simple sentiment analysis application built with Streamlit, TensorFlow, and NLTK. The application allows users to input text and receive a sentiment prediction (positive or negative) based on a pre-trained model.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: The app preprocesses input text by removing mentions, hashtags, URLs, non-letter characters, and stopwords.
- **Sentiment Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to predict the sentiment of the input text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive and easy-to-use interface.

## Installation

To run the application, you need to have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
